1. [ACR103 Week 2](#acr103-week-2)
   1. [Thin things ( not a big detail)](#thin-things--not-a-big-detail)
      1. [Make a thing with a fabric or strap loose](#make-a-thing-with-a-fabric-or-strap-loose)

<!-- /code_chunk_output -->


> **Cover:**
> * Assignment 1
> * Teach by modelling, then explain. Model something with holes, thin part.
>   - Changing things in channel box ( primitives after creation, )
      - video link
>   - pivot: d to toggle pivot edit. snap it to things. Center.
>     - video link
>   - move/rotate/scale tool options in modeling toolkit (again)
>   - **Boolean - pictures** easier than explaining
>   - N-gons, getting rid of them with edges. **pictures**
>     - Find n-gons in maya: https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-modeling/training/modeling/tris-quads-n-gons/
>   - Thin things
>   - Bevel?
>   - Freeze transformations from channel box.
>   - Live surface and quad draw? Definitely requires a video. If can't find good one, might have to make one.
>     - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=takFYSXDxzg pretty good?
>     - Question will be how to separate out the new mesh easily.
>     - Tell people to keep it simple!
>     - Make sure they can exit live object.
>     - Time to use Wireframe mode
>     - Maybe too much trouble. Provide as a research topic, rather than teaching in class. Just demo it and provide links.

> **Time:**
> 1 hour modeling demo?
> 10 mins discuss assessment, 50 mins pick model/plan modeling/come up with modifications?
> 1 hour present your model plan

> **Present model plan**
> Demonstrate. 
> 1. Pick a concept for myself
> 2. Make design change ( more chunky, add blanket).
> 3. Plan build. "This will be cubes extruded, bevel these edges. Here i'll make two planes, then bridge them. 

> **Resources:** 
> Tim Kaminski modeling toolkit videos .

```cpp { .line-numbers, highlight=7-8 }
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "hello";
  return(0);
}
```
Assignment Week 2:
  1. 20 mins find, Learn about assessment
  2.  30 mins to pick an item, decide on additions
  3. 30 mins **Present** Come up front and describe what you'll model. What changes you'll make, if any. What do you see being tricky.
  
  Break
    - Others can provide ideas/feedback
    - Try to be constructive with feedback, push them forward not back.
    - Make sure the source images are on my notes + machine so people can just walk up.

  - Now you need to try things, find the barriers, the challenges you'll need to overcome
  - So start, start blocking

Week 3:
  1. How to add details, add flat material colour

Week4:
  1. Rendering, shading.

## Thin things ( not a big detail)

We did blocky things. They have lots of room to work

_**- pic of 3d barrel -**_

Who would you do thin things without a nightmare of selecting.?

_**- bendy strap box with things close together -**_

We can make that as a flat surface, then thicken later.

### Make a thing with a fabric or strap loose

_**- shot of concept -**_
