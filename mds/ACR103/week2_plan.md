> * Teach by modelling, then explain. Model something with holes, thin part.
>   - Changing things in channel box ( primitives after creation, )
      - video link
>   - pivot: d to toggle pivot edit. snap it to things. Center.
>     - video link
>   - move/rotate/scale tool options in modeling toolkit (again)
>   - **Boolean - pictures** easier than explaining
>   - N-gons, getting rid of them with edges. **pictures**
>     - Find n-gons in maya: https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-modeling/training/modeling/tris-quads-n-gons/
>   - Thin things
>   - Bevel?
>   - Freeze transformations from channel box.
>   - Live surface and quad draw? Definitely requires a video. If can't find good one, might have to make one.
>     - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=takFYSXDxzg pretty good?
>     - Question will be how to separate out the new mesh easily.
>     - Tell people to keep it simple!
>     - Make sure they can exit live object.
>     - Time to use Wireframe mode
>     - Maybe too much trouble. Provide as a research topic, rather than teaching in class. Just demo it and provide links.

> **Time:**

> discuss assessment
> pick and present your concept
> start blocking out
> I'll be doing modeling demo

lots of links to video and documentation because ppl can't listen and model at once.

> 3. Plan build. "This will be cubes extruded, bevel these edges. Here i'll make two planes, then bridge them.
