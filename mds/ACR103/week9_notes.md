## Character modeling!

It's a deep subject
It includes:
* Prop and hard-surface modeling skills
  - They have props on them, they wear armor/tech
* Knowledge of anatomy, and mechanics of movement 
* Understanding of facial expressions and how to support them
* Great subtlety: the brain dedicates a lot of neurons to recognising human faces and forms. Tiny differences stand out.


>**Anyone\* can learn**, it's just practise + study:
>- Anyone who is super invested
>- It requires a disgusting amount of hours put in
>- That's before and during a career, at work and at home

### Biting off what you can chew

We're learning a bunch at once: 
1. how to model a character from concept + style reference 
2. How to uv unwrap.
2a. How to uv unwrap a character, which is specialized
3. How to use 3D coat and photoshop in texturing
4. How to paint stylized characters for games
  
**That's more topics than we have weeks.**

The answer: choose and model simpler characters with very low polygon counts.

## Assessment 3

Modeling, texturing and exporting a character to a game engine.

### Deliveries by week

I'll be tracking discussion post updates week by week, and this will feed into your marks on discussion participation and use of in-class techniques (30% of assessment marks)

Several will be via discussion group
## // DISCUSSION LINK

#### Week 10

Due **Weds 20/11**. Update discussion post with:
* A screenshot of pureRef displaying your :
  - 2D Concept image
  - 3D modeling/texturing style reference
* Discussion of what attracts you to the character concept and why you chose the style reference
* Screenshots of your 3D model in Maya showing its topology and form.

### Week 11

Due **Weds 27/11**. Update discussion post with:
* Feedback on two other students' model topology from week one
* Two Maya screenshot of your UV unwrapped character
  * In Maya's UVS workspace: perspective panel, uv editor.
  * With _image->dim_ enabled in uv settings so wires are clear
  * All character pieces selected so all uv wires are shown.
  * One shot with checkerboard turned on to show even coverage
  * Another shot with stretch/distortion hilighting enabled 
* A screenshot of your character in 3D Coat with baked ambient occlusion and first pass flat colours.

## Model with me

Modeling a basic character for texturing

* Identifying what needs geometry, what can be painted in.
* Minimum geometry for maximum value
* Poly count HUD
* Importance of hard vs soft normals

## Choose your concept

We won't be using our own concepts for this.

Here's a discussion between the Flipped Normals guys (industry pro character modelers and teachers) about why modeling from your own concepts is a bad idea for early learning and making portfolio pieces:

### Style reference

Style reference is critical
* You don't have one yet
* It's often not covered in the concept, and never 100% covered
* You will usually model to a style guide for a game
