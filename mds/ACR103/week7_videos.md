## Q: How modular (prefabby) is enough?
How modular does my scene need to be to to pass the assessment?
The goal, above all, is to build a part of a level in unity using your assets and get it lit.
* Ideally you'll build up prefabs from your imported fbx, making reusable modules. I've shown how to do it in the videos and a bit of googling gets all the info you need to do it. There are good marks there if you make smart use of prefabs.
* You _can_ work without prefabs and duplicate away, manually applying materials and so on. If you don't leave time to do it with prefabs but you get your level in there and lit, that should position you for a pass.
* Some objects you'll get to break down into tilable parts and ends. I did where I could, but some elements I won't have that done. Show me you can do it and understand it, but some elements can be exported whole for this assessment.

## Q: How should I use materials for this one?
* We'll mostly just use materials instead of textures.
* Exporting multiple objects in a single fbx so you can use materials on each bit
* Reusing materials so the scene doesn't get too heavy.

Working with layers.. moving from layer to layer, weirdness with groups.
