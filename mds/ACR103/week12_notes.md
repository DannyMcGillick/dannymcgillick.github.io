## Last week

UVs, discussion of lighting/painting, resources.

I asked you guys to: 
* watch the videos in the [week 11 notes](week11_notes.html#amazing-resources)
* look through Valves [TF2 art approach](week11_notes.html#game-study-tf2s-art-approach)
* Apply the techniques and ideas in the notes to your character, applying your main colours and large scale lighting, and to generally get as far as you can.

## This week

* Missing posts = missing marks
* Style reference
* Working with soft brush vs hard brush


## Missing posts are missing marks

### Assessment 2

![](assets/week12/money_marks_out_window.gif)
_Picture this money as marks_

* A2 (your level) marked, several hurt badly by no/minimal post in discussion
  - It was worth **40%**

### Assessment 3
* Looking at [marking guidelines for A3](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8008777_1&course_id=_75841_1) (character)
* Level 3 marking is happening Monday, and many people haven't posted their UVs to the 
* Imagine 40 percent just.. erased.

## Style reference

It's absolutely critical at this point to use your style reference.

Without it you're just slapping in colours from the concept and wondering if you did it right. 

### Pureref

USE PUREREF.

Our brains love to panic at this stage and say "there's no time for that! I have to put paint to pixels right now!". Or they'll throw up some other reason to resist a new practise when we're hurrying.

> However much you've looked at the style reference before, that's less than you need to :D Our brains are way better at overestimating their recall than accurately recalling things. 
> Keep style ref pics open in pureref, as well as the concept, and visible always on a 
screen. Prefereably your 3D Coat screen.


## Questions and help

- Ask away
- Rounds by Danny

## Soft vs Hard Brushes

Benefit of select/fill/hue shift in speedy changes.

## In photoshop

## In 3D Coat


* More about light sources and ambient (shadow) colour
* Detailing: applying the same planes of light to small features.
* Using colour contrast to pop things.
