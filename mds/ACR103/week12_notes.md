## Last week

Ambient lots of UV stuff. Quick go at ambient occlusion.

I asked you guys to: 
* watch the videos in the [week 11 notes](week11_notes.html#amazing-resources)
* look through Valves [TF2 art approach](week11_notes.html#game-study-tf2s-art-approach)
* Apply the techniques and ideas in the notes to your character, applying your main colours and large scale lighting, and to generally get as far as you can.

## This week

Demo of some details.
* Working with soft brush vs hard brush
* Using photoshop hard and soft brushes
* More about light sources and ambient (shadow) colour
* Detailing: applying the same planes of light to small features.
* Using colour contrast to pop things.
