## Last week

Ambient lots of UV stuff. Quick go at ambient occlusion.

I asked you guys to: 
* watch the videos in the [week 11 notes](week11_notes.html#amazing-resources)
* look through Valves [TF2 art approach](week11_notes.html#game-study-tf2s-art-approach)
* Apply the techniques and ideas in the notes to your character, applying your main colours and large scale lighting, and to generally get as far as you can.

## This week

Demo of some details.
* Style reference
* Working with soft brush vs hard brush
* Using photoshop hard and soft brushes
* More about light sources and ambient (shadow) colour
* Detailing: applying the same planes of light to small features.
* Using colour contrast to pop things.

## Style reference

It's absolutely critical at this point to use your style reference.

Without it you're just slapping in colours from the concept and wondering if you did it right. 

### Pureref

USE PUREREF.

Our brains love to panic at this stage and say "there's no time for that! I have to put paint to pixels right now!". Or they'll throw up some other reason to resist a new practise when we're hurrying.

> However much you've looked at the style reference before, that's less than you need to :D Our brains are way better at overestimating their recall than accurately recalling things. 
> Keep style ref pics open in pureref, as well as the concept, and visible always on a screen. Prefereably your 3D Coat screen.
