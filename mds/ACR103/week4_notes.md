<!-- /code_chunk_output -->

## Finalising details

1. Having a look at where people got to
2. Demonstration/chat: fixing probems people encountered
   a. Black faces? Manifold faces? Edges that won't delete?
3. Saving a todo list for anything remaining in details.

## Next Steps

We won't be finishing off the detail pass in class
* Next step is to close the loop: get your rendering sorted out, remove the last unknown.
* Get a half decent render you could deliver.
If there's time:
* Come back to adding missing details
* Improve render.
