## Assessment 1 Received 

Thanks for assessment 1 submissions.
* A couple issues, iâ€™ve messaged those people about correcting submission

## Weeks 5-8, modeling game environments

We'll learn about:
* Modular modelling
* Texturing
  - uv unwrapping
  - Applying textures
  - Creating/editing textures
  - Using wacom tablets
  - 3d coat and painter

_Low poly dagger with hand painted texture (diffuse)_

* Assembling usable level pieces from basic components
  - components like floors, walls, columns, doors
  - level pieces like repeating wall with floor, corner of room etc

Examples by [Glenatron](https://polycount.com/discussion/158818/another-modular-dungeon-tileset):

## Assessment 2: Level Modeling

(I'll provide a few concepts. You will be designing an environment based on the elements and style in them. You can modify the scene from say a level 1 dungeon to level 5 dungeon, or a lounge room to an attic bedroom). You can add elements that aren't there, but aim to match the style as if the game exists)
Designing and creating environment for game based on scope sheet from teacher

Scope will include:
1. Existing or theoretical world (ie strategy in world of paper blocks)
2. Creative expects: C.D., genre, texture quality/style, model quality/style.
3. Tech spec: poly count, texture specs, topology (quads or tris)

10-15 modular assets! 

Lighting: export to Unity and bake in ambient occlusion.
Export to sketchfab?

## How will we do it all?

- Choose and modify/extend a concept
- Model and uv unwrap in Maya
- Test with a texture designed to help uv mapping
- Export to 3D Coat/Photoshop for texturing.
- Import to Unity

## This week

### Choose concept

### Rough design of your level

### Figure out components you'll be making.

### model and texture a wall and floor 

## Next week
Present your designs
Work along as we uv unwrap a model, apply uv texture.
Pick simple component to model
