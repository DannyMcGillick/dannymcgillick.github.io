## This week
How to deliver the assessment
Setting the project to windowed and choosing a resolution
Using unity materials
Basic uv unwrapping and texturing of floor tile
3D Coat for those curious

## How to deliver the assessment
_Naming the project/file_
_Deleting tx file_
_Zipping the project_
Make Video

### Project resolution
You want me to see what you saw in the game view.
Setting player to windowed
Setting player resolution
Setting Game view to player resolution.
Make video

## Using Unity materials
PBR like Arnold.
Assigning to objects in a prefab
Different materials on objects in a single exported fbx
Using gloss and matte, metallic and not to create contrast.
Demonstrate in class

## Necessary Lighting info
Gloss only works once the reflect map (from the hdr environment) is baked
Speed vs Quality: useful lightmap settings values.
Make video, screenshot settings with fields hilighted

## Basic UV unwrap
Images of packaging and papercraft. Print some
Creating uvs
Cutting edges and unfolding
Auto unfold, auto orient, auto layout!
screenshot good settings hilighted
short video

## Basic texturing
Export uvs layout image
Import to photoshop/krita
Install Krita portable if you want to and don't have photoshop at home. (check krita 3D coat integration)
- [Download Krita portable for Uni workstation](https://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/files/Krita%20Portable/)

Create texture in ps/Krita and apply in Unity (we'll apply in Maya next assessment)
(Add very simple rivets and bevel hilights to tiles)
Edit textured meshes in 3D Coat
Export texture from 3D Coat, overwriting Unity texture
Class demo.

## Further learning
Apply texture to phong/lambert/Arnold mat in Maya.
