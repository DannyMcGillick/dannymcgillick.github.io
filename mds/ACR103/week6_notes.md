## This week

* Staying on target for forum activity.
* Visit today and reserve a post (we'll double check post editing)
* Deciding/cutting out environment components from 2D concept
* More speedy modelling to a grid.
* Lighting the objects for forum presentation


## Staying on target: forum activity deliverables

From the brief, which can be downloaded from the [ACR103 Assessment 2 page on Blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8008776_1&course_id=_75841_1)

>**1. Participate and complete Week 6 Discussion Forum Activity – Environment Design and Modular Modelling**
>This online activity will require you to share and reflect on the environment design and modular modelling process based on the scope specified by your lecturer. You will do this by creating a simple floorplan or sketch of the environment you want to create, and at the same time taking snapshots of the modular elements you created. You will share these in the Week 6 Discussion Forum following instructions specified there. You will also share your reflection on the process by answering the following questions as part of this discussion forum post.
>
>**a)** What were your main inspirations and references in coming up with your design solution for your environment? **(100 words)**
>**b)** How well do you think your designed environment fits with the scope, genre and world specified by the brief or learning facilitator? **(100 words)**
>**c)** What were your main challenges in creating your modular elements? **(100 words)**
>Finally, the activity will also require you to view least 2 other students posts and commenting about the following:
>**a)** How effective do you think the modular elements created fit with the environment design created? **(50 words)**
>**b)** Suggest improvements that the student can make to enhance the modular 3d elements or environment design that was created. **(50 words)**

## Setting up forum post

My example forum post

## Finding components in your level concept

We'll need to choose a bunch of components that can be used like lego to make our level.

> Try opening your level concept in _Photoshop/Krita_ and then:
> 1. Putting a white background behind it
> 2. Turning down the opacity on the concept art layer
> 3. Create a new layer above, pick a bright, distinct colour and start outlining parts you'll need.
>
> Alternative: print out your level concept and draw over it with a marker/liner.

Then you can cut out parts of this image and throw them into _Pureref_. Now you have a heads-up display of what you're building.

## Continue speedy modeling on grid

Work on your pieces: wall, floor, props, stairs.



## Lighting your components for presentation

Learning to import into unity and how to bake lighting is probably too much for them this week on top of doing all the models plus it’s a lot of prep for me not crap preparation. We'll look into UVs, textures and light in week 7.

## Individual components, also modules made from them.

Colouring components and then using them in modules makes it clear what's unique and what's reuseable.
