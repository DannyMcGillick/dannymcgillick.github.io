* More speedy modelling to a grid.
* Lighting the objects for forum presentation


## Staying on target: forum activity deliverables

Info from brief

## Setting up forum post

My example forum post

## Finding components in your level concept

We'll need to choose a bunch of components that can be used like lego to make our level.

> Try opening your level concept in _Photoshop/Krita_ and then:
> 1. Putting a white background behind it
> 2. Turning down the opacity on the concept art layer
> 3. Create a new layer above, pick a bright, distinct colour and start outlining parts you'll need.
>
> Alternative: print out your level concept and draw over it with a marker/liner.

Then you can cut out parts of this image and throw them into _Pureref_. Now you have a heads-up display of what you're building.

## Continue speedy modeling on grid

Work on your pieces: wall, floor, props, stairs.



## Lighting your components for presentation

Learning to import into unity and how to bake lighting is probably too much for them this week on top of doing all the models plus itâ€™s a lot of prep for me not crap preparation. We'll look into UVs, textures and light in week 7.

## Individual components, also modules made from them.

Colouring components and then using them in modules makes it clear what's unique and what's reuseable.
