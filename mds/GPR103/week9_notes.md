# Week 9

Recap A2,  Look at A3. 

## Assessment 2

My code. Questions, suggestions.



## Assessment 3

Missile command using what we've learnt and proper project management.

### Gameplay

### Set up Hacknplan

Think of cards as cohesive chunks of work, and as problems that need cracking. Early ones are pretty easy, setting up

* Set up git
* Set up a working folder for the assessment, make aunity project.
* Example structure: 
>  - missileCommand
>    - unity
>    - psd
>    - resources

I add a project code to the end of the folders - super useful when they show up in your quick links or recent folders.

### Git project

Set it up, then clone the project into your `missileCommand/unity`

### Unity Project

Create a unity 2d project in another folder, say unityProject or unityTemp

![unity git folders](assets/week9/folders_unity_git.png)

* Now you can move the contents of the unityProject folder over to the unity folder you checked out from git and delete the empty folder.
* Changes appear in gitkraken
* Stage all the files, commit, push.
