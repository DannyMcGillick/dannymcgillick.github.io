Implement code that demonstrates the principle of encapsulation based on the spec below.

### Requirements:
•	Program in either C#/ Unity or C++/SFML. Using appropriate project structures to effectively test and run the solution.
•	Build the exercise to an executable.

### Goals:
* Use appropriate access modifiers and properties 
* Use console (Debug.Log) outputs in place of game functionality to test encapsulation and access.
* Initialise variables suitably
* Separate interface from implementation
