# Announcement 1, Welcome
# Online Version

Hi guys, and welcome to 2D Games Programming.

I'll be running a 90 minute online class each Tuesday from 2:30pm - 4:00pm. This will be streaming through collaborate on Blackboard, and a recording of the session will be available afterwards for those who miss class. Outside of those 90 minutes I'll aim to answer questions emailed or sent via Backboard pretty quickly. Mostly this will be Monday - Thursday except when I'm teaching.

Please install Visual Studio Community 2017 and Unity 2018.2.20f1 before Tuesday. You can find the instructions in my nearly completed class notes here: https://dmcgits.github.io/mds/GPR103/week1_notes.html#installing-unity . For the best chance of getting my help with any problems, install it as soon as you can. Also feel free to look through those notes.

This week we'll be getting to know each other and going over what the subject involves, what tools we'll be using, assignments and more. Finally we'll dive into Unity and get a simple script working. The original blackboard entry and powerpoint slides for module 1 on Blackboard deal with cohesion and coupling - we won't be covering that in class for the moment. Still, if you have a solid understanding of objects and classes and want great guidance on object oriented programming, go ahead and read those to learn more.

See you Tuesday,
Danny.
