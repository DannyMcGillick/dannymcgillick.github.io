# Announcement 1, Welcome

## Online Version

Hi guys, and welcome to 2D Games Programming!

I'll be streaming a class each Wednesday night from 8pm, lasting for between 1.5 and 2.5hrs. I learned last trimester that you guys are often more available at night, so I'm hoping 8pm is the sweet spot after dinner/family etc.

Classes will stream through Collaborate Ultra (not the old collaborate) on Blackboard and I've added a repeating session (2DProg) for the next 12 weeks. Recordings of the sessions will be available afterwards for those who miss class, but please do your best to attend the streams vs watching later: the students who made it to online classes and asked questions in the flow benefited in skills and marks last trimester.

The rest of the week I'll aim to answer questions emailed, sent via Blackboard or discorded pretty quickly.

### Installs required for first class

Please install Visual Studio Community 2017 (not 2019) and Unity 2018.2.21f1 (also not 2019) before Thursday! You can find the instructions in my class notes here: https://dmcgits.github.io/mds/GPR103/week1_notes.html#installing-unity. We're going to be creating a first project on day 1. Both installs are large, so if you try to do it on the day you won't keep up, plus it'll swamp your connection.

### My notes vs Blackboard slides

My notes are half-updated from last trimester, don't be surprised if you see a few notes-to-self or hanging sentences the next day two. The original blackboard entry and powerpoint slides for module 1 on Blackboard deal with cohesion and coupling, but we'll be more interested in inheritance vs composition. Still, if you have a solid understanding of objects and want to know more, read those too.

See you there,
Danny.


## F2F Version

Hi guys, and welcome to 2D Games Programming!

I imagine you've all seen our timetable by now and know we're in the Ultimo lab each Thursday at 11:30am. Each week there'll be theory, but there will also be plenty of practical work in Unity to make it stick.

The rest of the week I'll be available on email,  Blackboard or discord pretty quickly. Contact details to come in class.

If you don't install it before class you won't be able to get much help during class, plus it'll swamp your connection, so don't leave it till then.
