# GPR102 Week 1

Welcome, Object Oriented Design, C#

## Part 1: Studying 2D Game Programming


### What is this course?

Exploring 2D games programming.

> * Core concepts of game programming
> * `C++` or `Unity c#`
> * You should have basic programming, but there will be revision revision, and `c#` is much more welcoming than `c++`

### How will we make 2D games?

Two options:
* Unity engine and C#. In-class choice.
* C++ in Visual Studio with an engine. An option for those who have c++ experience and great optimism.

---

### C++?

* Bigtime game engines are written in C++, C.
* Fast, low level.
* ON it's own doesn't offer any game making tools, you'll need a basic multimedia engine like olcConsoleGameEngine.
* C++ engines outside of the scope of this course, only choose if you're already comfortable with one.

```c++
int main()
{

    printf("Battle Royale Game.");

}
```

### Unity, C#?

_I'm an artist, not a programmer!_

* No compiler, command line!
* A lot happens behind the scenes
* All the dirty work has been done

### Class and home hours

### Assignments

3 Assignments.
The first isn't really a game, it's how to make things that we would have in a game. Then we make them behave like they would in a game.
* What weeks?
* What deliverables?

## Part 2: Programming and Unity

> Let's learn by doing. We'll create a unity project, add something to our game, and give it behaviour.

1. Create a new Unity project. 2D.
2. Add sprites to the game.
3. Make the sprites do something with a script.

## So, what is programming?



SOURCE

* What is this course teaching?
* Who am I?
* Who are you?
* What is unity? C#? C++?
  * Did any of you know those things
* What are 2D games?
* What assignments will there be? What language?
* How much will assignments be in class vs at home?
* How can we check assignment/course info ourselves or ask for help (blackboard review)
* How does the class load work (i am with your for 3 hrs and you are expected to do at least 7 hours follow up to understand and practise what we learned, and to read through next week’s lecture slides).

* Oo programming review
* Unity + visual studio or code intro/review
* C++ visual studio review
* How unity composition differs from object oriented code.
* I won’t be teaching how to do composition in c++, but i can answer c++ language questions. If you find a technique or guide for composition/decorator we can chat. 

* Do i need to be a 2d artist? Asset store!
