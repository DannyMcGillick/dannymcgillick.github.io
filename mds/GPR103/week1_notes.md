## How will we make 2D games?

Two options:
* Unity engine and C#. In-class choice.
* C++ in Visual Studio with an engine. An option for those who have c++ experience and great optimism.

## C++?

* Bigtime game engines are written in C++, C.
* Fast, low level.
* ON it's own doesn't offer any game making tools, you'll need a basic multimedia engine like olcConsoleGameEngine.
* C++ engines outside of the scope of this course, only choose if you're already comfortable with one.
