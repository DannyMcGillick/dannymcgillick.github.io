## Welcome
Hi, welcome guys.

Who am I

Speak to who's there a bit. Young, old, etc.

## Games
We're all here because we like games! So we're all going to understand that bit.

Can I see hands for who plays rts games?
What about fps? MOBA? 
I'll be showing a stylized axe today that belongs most in maybe a 3rd person fantasy brawler.

## Today's goal

Some of you will have done some art or 3D, some of you won't. But whatever your level, whatever part of this resonates with you, I hope you all feel a little walk away feeling a bit of the, sort of buzz I do when I see an idea turning into a real game model. Substance Painter doesn't have a magic button by any stretch, even if this demo makes it look like it does, but it still feels a bit like magic. Also, you can screenshot some renders and take them with you on the pen drives on your desks.

## So! How does 3D game art work.

**Show Triangle** - (_Some will be on desks so people can pick them up. I'll go around and gather them and add to my shape as I talk._)

Well, this guy here is 3D games work. There are a lot of tools to make these, arrange them and colour them in, but at the end of the day your graphics card is moving these around and painting them. It's what reviewers are talking about with polygons per frame or per second when a new Playstation is about to drop. We'll come back to those and fill rate.

**Demonstrate flatness of a triangle**

You guys can see, when I pop off the ballbearing here, things are very flexible, we can move in any direction. But pop on that third ballbearing, or sphere, and a triangle has no way to flex, bend or assume anything other than a perfectly flat surface. 

> A triangle is the simplest shape we can make.  

Now, add another triangle, and things start to get interesting. We have a lot of play. then another, we can make a roiling carpet. If you have enough of them, and they're small enough, and you are free to make the edges as long or short as you need, you can make anything.

**Picture of a triangle**
About half the power of this goes into triangles.

Lets look at our axe as.. triangles a game can push.
