Making Games
=============

Mum, how do `fors` and `ifs` and `const unsigned long ints` turn into games?

* checking for inputs
* moving things
* checking things
* drawing things

and..

* doing it again.

Frames
------

Games are frames! Snapshots of time. We're going to use an engine to help us do it. olcConsoleGameEngine.

* Background
* Border
* Character and objects
* 
Checking Inputs

Key presses

Moving Things
