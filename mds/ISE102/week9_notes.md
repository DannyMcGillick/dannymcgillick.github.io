## Coding Standards

Conventions vary, but most every company that produces code has them. Reasons for conventions according to **Epic Games**

>
> * **80% of the lifetime cost** of a piece of software goes to **maintenance**.
> * Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
> * Code conventions **improve the readability** of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
> * If we decide to expose source code to mod **community developers**, we want it to be easily understood.
> * Many of these conventions are actually required for **cross-compiler compatibility**.
