# How to Install Visual Studio Community

We are using **Visual Studio _2017_**

**Do not download and install Visual Studio _2019_ for this subject.**

_Microsoft's longer, more detailed version of the following instructions is here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=vs-2017>_ 

If you already have Visual Studio: search for and run the Visual Studio Installer, select More > Modify (next to the launch button), then go to step 3. Otherwise,

1. Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/. **Don't click "Download Visual Studio", instead scroll down and expand "2017"** to download.
2. Run the installer. At a point it will ask you to select a _workload_.
3. Under _Workloads_ you'll see the _Windows_ section. Select _**Desktop development with C++**_.

4. At the bottom right set _install while downloading_ and click _**install**_. (If you already had VS2017 you'll click _**modify**_)
