# Announcement 1, Welcome

## Face To Face

Hi guys, and welcome to Intro to Software Engineering. As you've probably seen from your timetable, classes are each Monday from 11:30am. That said:

THIS MONDAY IS A PUBLIC HOLIDAY so class will be on TUESDAY at 11:30am (room number and approval is pending). Please do your best not to miss the first class: we'll be learning to create and compile C++ projects in visual studio on day 1, and you'll need that.

CLASS REQUIREMENT: if you're using your own laptop install Visual Studio Community 2017 before Wednesday, because we'll be writing our first program in class! You can find it here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/. Don't click "Download Visual Studio", scroll down and expand "2017" to download. When it asks you what workloads/languages you want to install, select: "Desktop development with C++" in the windows section. 

For a step by step visit my notes at https://dmcgits.github.io/mds/ISE102/week1_notes.html where it's the last item in the contents. Click on Appendix 1: Install Visual Studio Community.

Outside of class time I have another hour or so each week dedicated to answering messsages/email etc. When I'm not in teaching or marking I'll usually answer email fastest, followed by blackboard. Reach me at daniel.mcgillick@laureate.edu.au.

See you there,
Danny

## Online Class

Hi guys, and welcome to Intro to Software Engineering.

I'll be running online classes each Wednesday from 11:30am. Each will go for between 90 and 150 minutes roughly ending between 13:00 and 14:00. These will be streaming through Collaborate Ultra on Blackboard. There will be a recording of the session available afterwards for those who miss class. Be warned: students who attend zero classes and rely purely on catchup videos so far have not done very well compared to those who have. Come along and make sure you get to ask questions in the flow of the class.
