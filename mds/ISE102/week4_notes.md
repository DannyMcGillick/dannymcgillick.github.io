# ISE102 Week 4

Functions! Taking chunks of code and breaking them out into reusable bits.

## Reusing code

We'll end up writing code that is really useful, and wanting to call on it a lot. Loops let us do that last week, but there are plenty of times it won't be that simple. Reacting when a player clicks or taps, for example.

### First Function

You've already written it!

```c++

int main()
{
	return (0);
}
```

A function can be thought of as a fancier variable. It's just a variable that does something clever.


> **Variables:** defining values like `5`, `"Kendrick"`, `true`, `35.5`
