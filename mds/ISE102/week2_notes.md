# ISE201 Week 2

(Variables, literals, operators, statements.
Conditionals, logical tests, enum.)

What we're learning is the _c++_ implementations of the absolute fundamentals of coding. 

> **Variables:** defining values like `5`, `"Kendrick"`, `true`, `35.5`
> **Logic Operators:** How to compare/test values.
> **Math Operators:** +, -, = and all the rest.
> **Conditionals:** Choose what to do next, based on a value or test. 
> **Statements:** A line of code that does something

Relational?

## Variables (and literals)

Let's look at this psuedocode:

```
start program HANDLE_A_LOW_ON_HEALTH_SITUATION

	I have: red healing potion bottle, blue invisibility potion bottle.

	If my red healing potion bottle is full: 
		drink it all
	Otherwise:
		If invisibility potion is full:
			drink that. We can get away to safety. 
		Otherwise:
			Well we're out of options. Good luck.

	now let's run away
end program HANDLE_A_LOW_ON_HEALTH_SITUATION
```

## Conditionals
