# Danny McGillick  

I'm a **3D and 2D character artist** working in the games industry across console, pc and mobile. I use mostly *ZBrush*, *Maya*, *Substance Painter*, *Marmoset Toolbag*, *Unity* and *Photoshop*. Before games I worked in advertising agencies as a **Creative Technologist** building augmented reality, motion sensing, 3D and mobile interactive experiences.

##### VIEWABLE WORK

Professional and Personal 3D/2D: [ Artstation](http://www.artstation.com/dmacdraws)  
Advertising work: [Cargo Collective](http://cargocollective.com/dannymcgillick)   

## Flexible 3D workflow 
- **High poly assets** with *ZBrush* and *Substance Painter* allows characters to be downrezzed to various platforms via retopo or auto LOD. 
- Decimation Master/auto uv/procedural PBR to **see meshes in engine from blockout stage onward**.
- Solve volumes in *ZBrush* deformed base meshes rather than rounds of turnarounds in 2D.  

## Character and prop design

I started in 2D and try to follow the principles of character design developed and refined in 2D and 3D animation.

- **All digital workflow:** reference boarding, sketching, developing, iterating, painting over models in *Photoshop* via Wacom Cintiq display. 
- Exploration of wide variety of forms, features and costume variations
- Strong use of reference to add familiarity to fantasy.
