<p>I’m currently a  <strong>3D and 2D artist</strong> working in the games industry across console, pc and mobile. I use mostly <strong><em>ZBrush</em>, <em>Maya</em>, <em>Substance Painter</em>, <em>Marmoset Toolbag</em>, <em>Unity</em> and <em>Photoshop</em></strong>. Previously I worked in advertising agencies as a Creative Technologist building augmented reality, motion sensing, 3D and mobile interactive experiences. Earlier still I built and supported high end graphics machines for post production along with their software. These were editing, compositing and 3d workstations by Silicon Graphics and Avid (Apple PowerPC). I studied Computer Science at UTS.</p>
<p>The bulk of my recent work is unnanounced and can’t be shown digitally, but here is my prior work.</p>

<p>How I created assets for Blowfish Studios, Halfbrick Games, Torus Games:</p>
<h3 id="flexible-workflow">Flexible workflow</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>High poly assets</strong> with <em>ZBrush</em> and <em>Substance Painter</em> allows characters to be downrezzed to various platforms via retopo or auto LOD.</li>
<li><strong>Low poly diffuse assets</strong> created in Maya or ZBrush and UV’d in <em>Unfold 3D</em> to maximise texture coverage and focus texel density on the head and torso.</li>
<li><strong>Hand painted textures</strong> in 3D coat leveraging baked AO and edge maps to save time.</li>
<li><strong>Fast in-engine blockouts</strong> via decimation, auto uv, color ID maps and procedural textures.</li>
<li><strong>Use of 3D in concept phase</strong> for silhouette discovery using base meshes/kit bash rather than slow revisions of 2D turnaround.</li>
<li><strong>Create scripts</strong> for Maya and ZBrush, heavily customise hotkeys and UI to make apps specific to workflow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="character-and-prop-design">Character and prop design</h3>
<p>I started in stylised 2D and try to follow the same principles in 3D.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All digital workflow:</strong> reference boarding, sketching, developing, iterating, painting over models in <em>Photoshop</em> via Wacom Cintiq display.</li>
<li><strong>Exploration</strong> of wide variety of forms, features and costume variations</li>
<li>Strong <strong>use of reference</strong> of subject, style and workflow to add familiarity to fantasy.</li>
</ul>
