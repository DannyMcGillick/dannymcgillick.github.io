Teaching / Game Art / Programming 

##Now

**Teaching:** I'm currently teaching **game art** (3D modelling,sculpting, texturing) and **software engineering** (introductory c++ and and Unity with c#) at Torrens University's Media Design School. I also do host 90 minute workshops/intros for the university.

## Previous work

**2D and 3D character artist:**, creating concepts through to textured models in the games industry across console, pc and mobile. I use mostly *ZBrush*, *Maya*, *Substance Painter*, *Marmoset Toolbag*, *Unity* and *Photoshop*. Blowfish Studios, Halfbrick, Wayforward, Torus Games.

**Creative Technologist:** Before games I worked in advertising agencies programming and creating 3D/2D assets for augmented reality, motion sensing, 3D and mobile interactive experiences. This was in **Unity (c#) and Flash (AS3** to desktop and mobile via AIR). We Are Social, DAN (Whybin/TBWA), One Digital.

**Support Tech and Demo Artist**: Further back I provided support for post production software including Avid Media Composer and Side FX Houdini across MacOS and Irix. I demonstrated Houdini live at Digital Media World.

## Side Hustle

I make **custom cables** for the mechanical keyboard community. Growing into artisan keycaps shortly.

## Online and F2F Teaching 
Markdown notes, base meshes and custom brushes for students, github repos of sample code projects.

## Flexible 3D workflow 
- **High poly assets** with *ZBrush* and *Substance Painter* allows characters to be downrezzed to various platforms via retopo or auto LOD. 
- Decimation Master/auto uv/procedural PBR to **see meshes in engine from blockout stage onward**.
- Solve volumes in *ZBrush* deformed base meshes rather than rounds of turnarounds in 2D.  

## Character and prop design

I started in 2D and try to follow the principles of character design developed and refined in 2D and 3D animation.

- **All digital workflow:** reference boarding, sketching, developing, iterating, painting over models in *Photoshop* via Wacom Cintiq display. 
- Exploration of wide variety of forms, features and costume variations
- Strong use of reference to add familiarity to fantasy.
