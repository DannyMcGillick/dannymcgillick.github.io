## Now: Teaching

I'm currently teaching **game art** (3D modelling,sculpting, texturing) and **software engineering** (introductory c++ and and Unity with c#) at Torrens University's Media Design School. 

I also do host 90 minute workshops/intros for the university, currently in **Substance PBR texturing workflow**.

This was in **Unity (c#) and Flash (AS3** to desktop and mobile via AIR). We Are Social, DAN (Whybin/TBWA), One Digital.

## Skills

My focusses in art, teaching and programming.

### Online and face to face teaching 

Markdown notes, base meshes and custom brushes for students, github repos of sample code projects.

### Illustration/character and prop concepting

I started in 2D and try to follow the principles of character design developed and refined in 2D and 3D animation. 
- **All digital workflow:** reference boarding, sketching, developing, iterating, painting over models in *Photoshop* via Cintiq display. 
- Exploration of wide variety of forms, features and costume variations
- Strong use of reference to add familiarity to fantasy.

### 3D: High-to-low workflow 
- **High poly assets** with *ZBrush* and *Substance Painter*, models can be optimized to various platforms via retopo or auto LOD. 
- Decimation Master/auto uv/procedural PBR to **see meshes in engine from blockout stage onward**.
- Concept, solve early forms for turnarounds in *ZBrush* using base meshes reducing revisions of 2D.  -
